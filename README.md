pandoc-jats
===========

A Lua [custom writer for Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#custom-writers) generating JATS XML.

### Installation
Just download the file `JATS.lua` and put it in a convenient location. Pandoc includes a lua interpreter, so lua need not be installed separately. You need at least Pandoc version 1.12, released September 2013 (this release added YAML metadata and Lua writer support).

### Usage
To convert the markdown file `example.md` into the JATS XML file `example.xml`, using the bibliography `example.bib` and the citation style `apa.csl` (all these files must be in the same directory, or specify the path) use the following command:

    pandoc -f example.md --filter pandoc-citeproc --bibliography=example.bib --csl=apa.csl -t JATS.lua -o example.xml

### Metadata
The metadata required for JATS can be stored in a YAML header - the same format that is also used by the Jekyll static blog generator. An example [from a recent blog post](http://blog.martinfenner.org/2013/12/11/what-can-article-level-metrics-do-for-you/) is below:

### Validation
The JATS XML should be validated, for example with the excellent [jats-conversion](https://github.com/PeerJ/jats-conversion) tools written by Alf Eaton.

### To Do
The focus of the first release was to generate valid JATS. This means that not all elements and attributes are supported, or that the support could be improved (e.g. for references). We also want to add configuration settings for publisher and journal elements, so that we don't have to store them in the article metadata. And the Lua code should be refactored, e.g. the `Doc` function is too complex.

### Feedback
This tool needs extensive testing with as many markdown documents as possible. Please open an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mfenner/pandoc-jats/issues) if you find a conversion problem.
